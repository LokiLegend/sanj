const reasons=[
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"organized\", out of all the skills you have I am grateful I am trying to adapt this one from you.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"competitive\", you'd eat your opponents for lunch while having a cute smile on your face.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"smart\", you don't accept or show it as much but boy when you wear those glasses xd.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"curious\", it often takes me a second to tell you an idea that would be exciting to learn and I just watch your eyes lit up.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"loyal\", not just towards me, your friendships, your girlies, your work, whatever you do, you ensure that you always build that loyalty around it.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"so goddamn cute\", no matter how fucked my brain is I melt in seconds when I see your face, like how cute can one be bc.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"a fashion influenza\", I have never till date seen you in an outfit which feels eh could have done better, every occasion, every event and you just know how to appear, and I lose my mind almost each and every time.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"a gamer\", BC my biggest turn on ever, I don't like to say it more often because I know you have got guys left, right centre hitting on you when you snipe skulls but boy you look hot when you play.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"honest\", the one thing that I respect the most about you is this and hence what everyone else says feels noise, you genuinely take efforts to build it and that's my fav thing about you.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"driven\", I am not sure if you feel the same or not but working in cafes with you was an absolute powerful energy that I haven't got with any girl ever, random marketing or business conversations, getting locked in and I miss it so damn much.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"supportive\", I am sure you're different kind of supportive to others, you'd comfort them, make them feel good, but I know you love belting me the most xd but you always there by my side and that gives me so much strength, and that mixer was just the best example of it.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"an underrated artist\", I mean I would so wanna scream to the world and tell them how much more you are than just a dancer, you used to sing, you play a fucking piano, you act, you creative af in ads etc everytime I hear a story of I used to do this when I was this, I am fucking amazed.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"BAKCHOD\", I have a list of more than 100 things that we have done which are hilarious as fuck but makes absolute no sense, right from me giving you a medal for the operations ants you performed in the room, the strategy and monkey cart, wavvyy and so much random shit. Time flies when you are around and its often one of the best times.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"so good with your parents\", the way you respect your mom dad even tho so much stuff happens which pisses you off, they literally sit and gossip with you that's just so adorable to watch.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"a crazy marketeer\", the world shall see it soon, but I can see the sign clear af, right from your zepto animated series to go zero ads, you really have it in you to be the creative heads of a crazy big global brand.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"resilient\", I have seen you break down a 100 times and get back happy the next hour, self pity is the best luxury a human can have, but you hate it and just get back up, that needs strength and mindset and you blessed with them both lady.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"thoughtful\", just not when it comes to gifting me but you do want to be thoughtful around people in whatever they might need or would make them feel better and in return wanna be part of the Sanj Fan Club because no one can escape it.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"the vibe\", there are people who are good at setting the vibe but that's not you because you are the vibe, it's a blessing how your presence itself does the trick effortlessly, setting a vibe needs energy, ability to talk etc but when I see you come in rooms and everyone wanting to be around you with \"sanjuuuuu\" I always lose my mind on how amusing you naturally are.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you \"the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in traditional\", and you transition from a cute little girl to a woman of dreams, in seconds.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"funny\", let me correct that to you're the fucking effortlessly funniest girl I ever know and that's honestly what I fell for first.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"organized\", out of all the skills you have I am grateful I am trying to adapt this one from you.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"kind\", more to cats, dogs, friends, a random pen on the table than me, but while I love taking care of you it melts my heart to see you being sweet and kind to people who need it, the way you tear up when you watch a sad reel, just tells me what a beautiful soul you are.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re a \"blessing\", I've been blessed having you around and you just make my life so much better and make me a better human which almost no one has been able to or tried to in the last 25 years for me.",
"The reason you’re so special is because you’re \"the reason I feel like making a lot of money QUICKLY\", its just looking at you I feel you deserve to have breakfast in New York, lunch in Chicago, chill at a beach in Hawaii and a dinner in LA and I will give you that one day.",
"**Grand Finale** — I have seen you smile, laugh, cry, angry, sad, annoyed, depressed, confused, anxious, overwhelmed and all available emotions you have, its cliche to say laughing is my fav one which indeed it is but I would always value the tears more, I would always want you to feel safe with your emotions around me and talk whatever is running in your mind without having to think twice. This is your birthday so I am gonna keep it more around you, there are a million attractive things about you but the one that I value the most is how you fight every single day, its surely not been easy, you have sometimes taken things more than you could handle but you did all of them with honesty regardless of the result. I know for a fact that you shall win, today or tomorrow but I am certain you will and I will clap for you when you do. I wish you all the fucking happiness in the world, take some of mine too because watching you laugh is just worth it. Happy 25th Birthday Sanj, I am proud of how far you've come and I am excited to see you shine ahead."
